{"name":"Sinatra-boilerplate","tagline":"Boilerplate code for a Sinatra app","body":"# Sinatra Boilerplate\r\n\r\nI have been using Sinatra for a while, and have loved every moment of it. It's so simple create any type of application, from REST APIs to database applications. It's only problem is that it doesn't have a scaffolding tool, neither a command line tool. I found it quite frustrating at times, when I had to make quick apps, with it. So I tried to fix it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nInstead of creating a whole rubygem just for my small problem, I created a boilerplate for Sinatra, so all I had to do was copy or git clone the code, and I'd been on my way. I created it a while back, and a lot of people have been asking me about how my Sinatra apps are so well structured, and so I thought I'd open-source the code, just like I did for my [static boilerplate project](https://github.com/karlcoelho/coelho-boilerplate).\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt contains the following gems :-\r\n- [sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) - the gem itself.\r\n- [sinatra-contrib](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-contrib) - some extensions for Sinatra\r\n- [sinatra-assetpack](https://github.com/rstacruz/sinatra-assetpack) - asset management for Sinatra\r\n- [sinatra-static-assets](https://github.com/wbzyl/sinatra-static-assets/) - some helper methods for static content in 'public'\r\n- [sinatra-flash](https://github.com/SFEley/sinatra-flash) - flash messages in Sinatra\r\n- [datamapper](http://datamapper.org/) - for the databases\r\n- [dm-migrations](https://github.com/datamapper/dm-migrations) - Migrations to help with DataMapper\r\n- [dm-sqlite-adapter](https://github.com/datamapper/dm-sqlite-adapter) - A DataMapper adapter for SQLite. I love SQLite.\r\n- [rack](http://rack.github.io/) - ruby web server handler, needed for heroku deployment\r\n\r\nFor some static content, it uses :-\r\n- [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)\r\n- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)\r\n- [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)\r\n\r\nThe app has been split into some what of an MVC format. Yeah, weird I know, but I designed for little more complex Sinatra apps, if you're going for large projects - Just use Rails. It'll help in the long run, Rails has a lot more to offer. Eventually I'll branch out another version of the boilerplate in a single file format, so check the branches of this repository if there is one.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI hope to help the community with this project.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDo let me know what you think about it, [by tweeting at me](http://twitter.com/therealcoelho).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
